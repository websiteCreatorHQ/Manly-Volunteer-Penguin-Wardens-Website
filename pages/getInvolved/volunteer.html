					The volunteer penguin wardens patrol critical areas nightly from the beginning of the season when the first penguins are noted to have come back in to their burrows. Temporary signage and barriers have been erected by volunteers in an effort to protect the birds whilst they are nesting and prevent unleashed dogs and public from getting too close to the birds or disturbing their nests. Manly Council recently installed permanent steel gates and adequate signage.

					We are always on the lookout for Penguin Wardens. Receive training and become accredited with NPWS, make new friends and help save Manlyâ€™s Little Penguins. It's fun exciting and helps the environment.
