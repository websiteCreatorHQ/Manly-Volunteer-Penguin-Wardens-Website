				<h1>Threats to survival</h1>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						The major threat to the Manly population is the loss of suitable habitat. Past development has greatly reduced available habitat in the area.
					</li>
					<li>
						Habitat still has the potential to be lost as residents renovate or develop their properties around the foreshore.
					</li>
					<li>
						Predators such as dogs and foxes pose a threat particularly if penguins are in shallow burrows and as they move between the water and their nests.
					</li>
					<li>
						Many people walk their dogs around the foreshore, often without a leash. Dogs have also come ashore and accessed the penguin colony via boats.
					</li>
					<li>
						The area the colony occurs in is a busy one. Disturbance around nesting areas from movement, noise and light from nearby buildings, waterway and fishing activities is another threat.
					</li>
					<li>
						Penguins will delay their arrival to the nest to feed their chicks if they perceive any disturbance. This means that there is less food for the young as the longer the adults are delayed, the more food will be digested by them.
					</li>
					<li>
						As awareness of the population grows, there is increased interest from some people to access the penguins. There have been incidences of nests being deliberately tampered with or completely destroyed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Weed removal around the foreshore is another major threat to the colony. The penguins rely on vegetation for cover and many nests and penguin access and egress routes are hidden by and amongst weeds, particularly lantana.
					</li>
					<li>
						As well as providing cover from predators and humans, vegetation, both native and non-native, helps to protect the penguin's habitat by stabilizing topsoil, slowing and scattering surface runoff and providing shade which reduces heat.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pollution may adversely impact the colony. Stormwater runoff and rubbish dumping can destroy nesting habitat and expose penguins to pollutants. Oil spill incidents are another threat to the colony.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pollution from stormwater, sewerage overflows, watercourses and atmospheric fallout affect water quality and substrate composition and may affect penguin health.
					</li>
					<li>
						Industrial and urban inputs into the harbor can also contaminate the penguins' food source.
					</li>
