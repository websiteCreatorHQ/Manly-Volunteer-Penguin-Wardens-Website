						These penguins inhabit a range from the South of Western Australia across the rest of Southern Australia and up into New South Wales. Bass Strait and Tasmania is a stronghold for the species. They are also present around the entirety of the New Zealand Coast and a range of offshore islands. They inhabit sandy beaches, sand dunes, caves and rock crevices. In some circumstances they have been known to reside under man-made structures

						That means they generally do not enter the shore before dusk and leave it before dawn. They forage during the day and often will sleep beside the nest at night after they have fed chicks. This species nests in burrows, under trees, in rock crevices, and sometimes in caves. Usually nests are clustered to form colonies, but single breeding pairs are not uncommon. At sea Fairy penguins are often found alone or in small groups of up to ten birds, but sometimes these groups can be much larger. Although foraging trip durations can be highly variable, Fairy penguins tend to stay close to the coast.
