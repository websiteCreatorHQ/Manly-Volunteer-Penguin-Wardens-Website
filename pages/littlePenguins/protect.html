				<h3>Keep Sydney Harbor clean </h3>
				<p>
					Put your rubbish in the bin as discarded waste can suffocate and injure little penguins. Fishing lines and hooks on the foreshore or in the water can strangle them or injure their feet and flippers. Be a good citizen and pick up other rubbish too! <br />
					Report any pollution to the Environment Line on 132 555 (24 hours, 7 days).
				</p>
					
				<h3>Keep pets away from critical habitat </h3>
				<p>
					Dogs, cats and foxes are still a big threat to little penguins and are excluded from the little penguins' critical habitat. Owners need to keep pets indoors or in secure backyards at night.
				</p>
				
				<h3>No vegetation removal or building works without approval in Critical Habitat B </h3>
				<p>
					For more information, visit the critical habitat page for Manly little penguins.
				</p>
					
				<h3>Report anyone harming the penguins </h3>
				<p>
					It is an offence to harm little penguins, their habitat or critical habitat. Report anyone undertaking illegal activities or causing harm to a little penguin including hunting, shooting, poisoning, netting, snaring, spearing, pursuing, capturing or trapping them. Contact the Environment Line on 131 555. <br />
					Phone Manly Council on (02) 9976 1500 or the National Parks and Wildlife Duty Officer on (02) 9457 9577 to report any dogs, cats or foxes in critical habitat areas or anyone disturbing little penguins and their nests.
				<p>
				
				<h2>During breeding season (May to February):</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						Minimize noise and light on the foreshore or on the water as they can delay penguin from returning to their burrows. The presence of people or light near burrows at night can make penguins abandon their nests altogether.
					</li>
					<li>
						Donâ€™t use flash photography or shine torches at penguins or around their burrows
					</li>
					<li>
						Be careful when boating. Boat strikes are a major cause of injury and death for little penguins. 
					</li>
				</ul>
